        <p>As mentioned on the front page, shithead is a different kind of unicellular organism. He isn't actually single-celled. I know this might be a shock to some of you since
            the last few pages were of information that could be useful (even if they were quite lengthy and hard to understand). That's not why you're here though is it? Can't be. 
            You're here to see shithead, the single-celled organism, aren't you? That's why you came here in the first place. You saw that 'Shithead' in the navigation bar and 
            were curious enough to press on it. That's why you're here now. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not mad that you're here. I'm just a little disappointed is all. 
            You could've been doing many other things than being on this webpage. What a shame. You really don't want to go outside to touch some grass? There's a lot to do 
            out there. Or you can, you know, uninstall league of legends (To those who didn't have it installed, I am so proud of you and I hope you continue on the right 
            path of life). You could also try exercising. There are many tutorials for starting too if you aren't sure how to start. Oh and there's probably a local gym near you. Hey, 
            I don't know where you live so that could be entirely wrong. Either way, you don't need a gym to exercise. Go for a walk, go for a jog. Doesn't matter what you do, just 
            go out and exercise. What's that? You can't? Lazy fuck. Get off your ass and do some exercise. Anyway, back to the topic at hand, you wanted to see shithead right? My 
            favourite single-celled organism? Well you know what? Fine. But promise me this, you will uninstall league of legends, you will not play valorant, you will never have 
            Genshin Impact installed on your device and one more thing before I forget. Make sure you exercise. You got all of that? I'm sure you did. You are so prepared for a new 
            life of not being overweight. With all of that in mind, you can see shithead. He is below:

        <p>A unicellular organism (also known as a single-celled organism) is an organism that consists of a single cell unlike a multicellular organism
            (All species of animals, land, plants and most fungi are multicellular. They arise in various ways such as cell division or by aggregation of many single cells.). 
            The 2 categories that organisms typically fall into are Prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) and Eukaryotes (Protozoa, unicellular algae, unicellular fungi). Many 
            eukaryotes are multicellular while most prokaryotes are unicellular. Unicellular organisms are thought to be the oldest forms of life (possibly emerging 3.8 to 4 billion years ago)
            , but as you continue reading through, you might realise that some unicellular organisms such as <a href="Shitheadreal.html">Shithead</a> 
            (Scientific name of stercore caput) are not quite the same.

        <h2>
            A different kind of single-celled organism:
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are many types of unicellular organisms, however none of them are quite like <a href="Shitheadreal.html">Shithead</a>. Or as some may say in Latin 'stercore caput'.
            Stercore caput is a different kind of species when it comes to unicellular organisms. It isn't actually a unicellular organism. The question then is...
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To be completely honest, there is no reason as to why stercore caput is a single-celled organism. I believe the reason for this is unknown. Single-celled organisms tend 
            not to have more than one cell since that's kinda the reason they are called unicellular. I mean seriously, think! Why would they be called single-celled organisms 
            if they were not even single-celled? SERIOUSLY! The nerves of these scientists, man! Sorry, I was going to keep this professional, but my God! I can't stand it when they 
            make stupid names for things. For example how is the blue whale a mammal? It lives in the sea no? Ok let me show u a few pictures (they are below, in case you didn't 
            know)

        <h2>Blue whale:</h2>
        <p>
            Ok so explain to me this, how the FUCK does this whale (shown below) a mammal? Tell me, does the whale fit more with the fish? (yes it does) OR the 
            land animals (mammals) where it almost never goes unless it's there to die. The answer is clear as day! No seriously why is it a mammal? Please explain.
        </p>

                Blue Whale, seriously why is it a mammal?

        <p>
            'Hey everyone, Peter here to explain why the blue whale is of the mammal species. Blue whales are just like humans and other land mammals (even though they don't go 
            on land, ever), they have three inner ear bones and hair. They breathe air and the females produce milk through mammary glands and suckle their young. Ok I get the 
            other guy now. Sure they might have similarities to mammals but what the fuck they don't fit with the other mammals at all. This is stupid. I quit my job. Tell 
            my boss that I don't even need the paycheck for the last 2 weeks. No seriously, I am done with this job I don't even wanna get money out of it anymore.'
            <br> <br>
            This was the last I heard from Peter. It was a video sent to our office after he had just received pay and not having been seen in 3 days. Guess that's it for ya. 
            I might quit my job too though this is stupid.
